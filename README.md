# CyberPatriot-Tools

These are a few tools I created while competeing in the AFA's National Youth Cyber Competition.
In the years I played *("Back in my day...")* we saw a steep increase in difficulty between seasons (VIII-X) and even between rounds as the compeition grew larger.
These tools are now a couple of years old, so I don't know how useful they will be in competiton now.
This repo serves mainly as a way for me to showcase that work to whoever wants to look at my GitHub profile (for some reason...) and also so I don't lose these files in the future.

## My Two Cents on Scripts

**Don't use a script if you don't understand what it's doing.**  
Scripts can be helpful and save you time, and I'm sure you can find hundreds of scripts out there that can do exactly what you want.
But if you just blindly run scripts, you are missing out on learning how to actually secure a system.
You haven't taken the time to critically consider which settings should be enable and disabled, and haven't drudged through the operating system looking for where to tweak those setting (which is half the fun!).
Even worse, you're missing the entire point of a security competiton! The number one rule of security is **Don't run any unknown programs from the Internet!**

I reiterate, scripts can be very useful and a great help, especially for repetitive, monotonous tasks *(That's why they exist!)*, but you don't gain anything if you don't understand them.
I encourage you to take some time to understand the scripts you're using, maybe look at these as a starting point, and write your own!
You will learn a lot by researching and writing your own scripts, a lot more than blindly copying someone else's.
